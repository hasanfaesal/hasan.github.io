    <h4 id="disclaimer"><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong></h4>
<p><strong><em>These are my personal views from experience. I’m not a prodigy who knows everything, I’m just someone who’s trying to make the best of time.
I highly respect all of my teachers.</em></strong></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Since the start of my Bachelors degree, <em>I’ve lost interest in multiple courses leading to lack of presence in class.</em> Everyday starts with logging into CMS and checking my attendance to make sure I’ll make 75%.</p>

<p>Time and time again, I’ve tried to attend class but I convince myself doing something better off. Here are a couple of examples in my 4th semester.</p>

<h4 id="entrepreneurship">Entrepreneurship</h4>

<p>Our Professor told us that we should be glad that this class is for 2 hours instead of being 3 hours. Me, thinking that how’ll
spend these 2 hours, was suprised by this statement. Immediately, I said that it should be 1.5 hours (optimal time).
I was met with a counter-question, <em>“what is your experience in education?”</em></p>

<p>Turns out I had <strong>‘offended’</strong> my Professor.</p>

<p>Soon after, I opened up <em>YouTube</em> to watch some tech content being bored from the lecture (decade old slides) and my classmate was doing market analysis on his laptop. We both were <em>instructed to turn off our devices</em> and pay attention to the lecture. Fair enough.</p>

<h4 id="data-communication-and-networking">Data Communication and Networking</h4>

<p>The instructor went over the basics such as how Data is represented in the form of text, numbers, audio, images and videos etc. I wasn’t particularly interested as I already knew the concept, I had worked with tensors representing multimodal data.</p>

<p>Curious to know what the course was offering, I turned to <em>Perplexity</em> to find out when <em>the instructor told me to shut off my mobile</em>. I told her that I’m searching for questions related to the course. She said that I should’ve ask her those questions instead.</p>

<p>I told her I was a fairly curious guy and had many questions, some of which are meaningless, unrelated and complex but I wasn’t excused.</p>

<p>So, I asked some questions that I already searched the web for and was met with <strong>gibberish</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Pakistani Professors (some of them) don’t tend to say that they don’t know the answer to a question.</strong> They’ll make up an answer on the spot.
I took enough <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare">OCW</a> to see that Professors often reply with <em>“I’ll look into that and get back to you”</em> when they don’t know the answer or have a vague idea.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h2 id="a-question-for-the-instructors">A Question for the Instructors</h2>
<p>Have you ever wondered why students aren’t paying attention in class?
Either they’ll be watching reels let alone searching the web, talking to each other or sleeping.</p>

<p>I’ll answer this question for you because I’ve done all of the above. Frequently, I indulge in a nap during the lecture.</p>

<p>I’ll pose <em>some</em> reasons for the above behaviour.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The lack of interaction</li>
  <li>Irrelevant subjects</li>
  <li>Non-permitted devices</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="1-the-lack-of-interaction">1. The lack of interaction</h3>
<p>I was listening to a podcast where <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/">Yann LeCun</a> said that the only difference between recorded lectures and live lectures is <strong>interaction</strong>.</p>

<p>Some of our professors just keep on reading the slides and explaining them. They are met with no questions neither do they ask questions from students. This is one-way communication and not like a conversation which makes it difficult for students to pay attention, memorize and engage actively.</p>

<p>Taking slight pauses between transitions of topics and asking thought-provoking questions from students is the way to go. I get it, students might not be inclined to answer. There is no motive for them but perhaps you can counter this with a reward system e.g: granting extra marks for answering questions correctly.</p>

<h3 id="2-irrelevant-subjects">2. Irrelevant subjects</h3>
<p>This is our <a href="https://archive.bahria.edu.pk/index.php/academics/under-graduate-programs/bsai/">roadmap</a> for Bachelors of Science in Artificial Intelligence. Courtesy of Higher Education Commission (HEC) Pakistan, some of the courses here make no sense whatsoever.</p>

<p>Teaching university students “Functional English” who’ve been through 12 years of studying and evaluation have already surpassed the need for this course. This is a waste of time and resources.</p>

<p>These are listed as ‘General Education Courses’ worth of <strong>30/133 credit hours</strong></p>

<h3 id="3non-permitted-devices">3.Non-permitted devices</h3>
<p>We meet different types of teachers, each with their own characteristics, style of teaching, temperament and rules etc. Similarly, we must understand that there are different types of students.</p>

<p>Some don’t have the courage to ask questions, some aren’t satisfied with the pace of the course, some have alot of questions etc. the list goes on.</p>

<p>The solution to this problem is use of laptops between lectures. I haven’t seen a single course online where laptops aren’t allowed. For example, even <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/">Harvard’s CS50x</a>, arguably the best <strong>Introduction to Computer Science</strong> course in the world shows students actively coding, taking notes, reviewing slides and paying attention to the Instructor.</p>

<p><em>Why do our Professors have strict rules of not allowing use of laptops?</em></p>
