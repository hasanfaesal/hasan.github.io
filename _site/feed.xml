<p>This is the continuation to my LinkedIn <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hasanfaesal_you-can-learn-anything-given-enough-time-activity-7276710765573607424-cFrE?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">post</a></p>

<p>As humans we must always adhere to some goals, seeking knowledge and truth is one of them. Hence, one must keep on learning till death. “Lifelong student” is a term that describes this best.</p>

<p>However, I was a person who never liked studying. I can say that I’ve wasted my life upto getting admission in University.</p>

<p>Understanding how the education system works took me my first semester and why it is like that and doesn’t change maybe another 4 months. I tried changing it, didn’t work out. I thought to myself, what can I do now?</p>

<h1 id="first-thing-to-learn-in-this-age">First thing to learn in this age</h1>
<p>Over the course of 4 months, I learnt a basic but important thing : “How to use the Internet”. I didn’t knew that the Internet had all of the answers, you just have to find them and trust me alot of people still don’t know it. 
Perhaps, LLMs are changing this? Perplexity is a great answer engine which makes this easier.
Everything is available on the Internet, mostly for free so why was I holding back?</p>

<p>To this day, still I’m discovering the best practices of using the Internet. This is one <a href="https://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">article</a> I’ve read recently on how to ask questions the correct way.</p>

<h1 id="the-start-of-my-journey">The start of my journey</h1>
<p>In my 2nd semester, I asked for advice from a senior regarding what to do in my free time? I wanted to invest in myself having enough time. He told me to start learning Data Structures and Algorithms and I followed his advice and covered the majority of the course in 2.5 months. I continued to study Machine Learning in my summer vacations.</p>

<h1 id="reviewing-back-on-time">Reviewing back on time</h1>
<p>I scrolled through my gallery to view old photos and I stumbled upon this one.</p>

<p><img src="&quot;assets/images/learn-anything1.jpg&quot;" alt="Image of a roadmap upto 8 months" /></p>

<p>One thing went through my mind, I’m better than I was 1 year ago. Throughout this year, I had my ups and downs thinking that will I ever be a professional? The answer is quite certain, your confidence increases as your learning does.</p>

<h1 id="never-finished">Never finished</h1>
<p>I believe I should’ve done more in this time span. I could’ve done more, however I’ll implement the practices I’ve learnt further in my journey.</p>

<h1 id="learn-anything">Learn Anything</h1>
<p>The conclusion I draw is one can learn anything, given enough time and effort. I had never studied Computer Science before in my life but alot has changed within the time span of a year. A year earlier, I could never have imagined myself learning these disciplines and doing these <a href="https://github.com/hasanfaesal">projects</a> and yet here I am.
This is best described in Sal Khan’s TED <a href="https://youtu.be/-MTRxRO5SRA?si=DZHaysO6NFOglQ1D">talk</a></p>

<p>I have more to do.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><category term="update" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[**incomplete but just pushed the changes idk why]]></summary></entry></feed>
