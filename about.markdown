I'm pursuing a Bachelors degree in Artificial Intelligence from Bahria University, Pakistan.
Currently, I'm studying AI and how it can be applied to real-world problems. I intend to shift my focus from doing courses
to learning by doing projects, which is a better way to learn. I've taken various courses online which reflect my dedication and commitment
to the field. As of now, I'm immersed in side-projects to learn by doing.

I'm 21 years old and I belong from Rawalpindi, Pakistan. I can say I've pretty much wasted my life till I got admission in University
realizing that how this will end up even worse. That's when I took I stand for myself and made an important discovery. "The Internet" and how to use it.

Apart from indulging in Computer Science, you'll find me playing Football, working out or often in Gaming.
