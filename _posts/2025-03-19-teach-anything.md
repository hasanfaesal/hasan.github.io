#### ***Disclaimer:***
***These are my personal views from experience. I'm not a prodigy who knows everything, I'm just someone who's trying to make the best of time.
I highly respect all of my teachers.***

<br>

Since the start of my Bachelors degree, *I've lost interest in multiple courses leading to lack of presence in class.* Everyday starts with logging into CMS and checking my attendance to make sure I'll make 75%.

Time and time again, I've tried to attend class but I convince myself doing something better off. Here are a couple of examples in my 4th semester.

####  Entrepreneurship

Our Professor told us that we should be glad that this class is for 2 hours instead of being 3 hours. Me, thinking that how'll
spend these 2 hours, was suprised by this statement. Immediately, I said that it should be 1.5 hours (optimal time).
I was met with a counter-question, *"what is your experience in education?"*

Turns out I had **'offended'** my Professor.

Soon after, I opened up *YouTube* to watch some tech content being bored from the lecture (decade old slides) and my classmate was doing market analysis on his laptop. We both were *instructed to turn off our devices* and pay attention to the lecture. Fair enough.

#### Data Communication and Networking

The instructor went over the basics such as how Data is represented in the form of text, numbers, audio, images and videos etc. I wasn't particularly interested as I already knew the concept, I had worked with tensors representing multimodal data.

Curious to know what the course was offering, I turned to *Perplexity* to find out when *the instructor told me to shut off my mobile*. I told her that I'm searching for questions related to the course. She said that I should've ask her those questions instead.

I told her I was a fairly curious guy and had many questions, some of which are meaningless, unrelated and complex but I wasn't excused.

So, I asked some questions that I already searched the web for and was met with **gibberish**.

**Pakistani Professors (some of them) don't tend to say that they don't know the answer to a question.** They'll make up an answer on the spot.
I took enough [OCW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCourseWare) to see that Professors often reply with *"I'll look into that and get back to you"* when they don't know the answer or have a vague idea.

## A Question for the Instructors
Have you ever wondered why students aren't paying attention in class?
Either they'll be watching reels let alone searching the web, talking to each other or sleeping.

I'll answer this question for you because I've done all of the above. Frequently, I indulge in a nap during the lecture.

I'll pose *some* reasons for the above behaviour.

1. The lack of interaction
2. Irrelevant subjects
3. Non-permitted devices




### 1. The lack of interaction
I was listening to a podcast where [Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/) said that the only difference between recorded lectures and live lectures is **interaction**.

Some of our professors just keep on reading the slides and explaining them. They are met with no questions neither do they ask questions from students. This is one-way communication and not like a conversation which makes it difficult for students to pay attention, memorize and engage actively.

Taking slight pauses between transitions of topics and asking thought-provoking questions from students is the way to go. I get it, students might not be inclined to answer. There is no motive for them but perhaps you can counter this with a reward system e.g: granting extra marks for answering questions correctly.

### 2. Irrelevant subjects
This is our [roadmap](https://archive.bahria.edu.pk/index.php/academics/under-graduate-programs/bsai/) for Bachelors of Science in Artificial Intelligence. Courtesy of Higher Education Commission (HEC) Pakistan, some of the courses here make no sense whatsoever.

Teaching university students "Functional English" who've been through 12 years of studying and evaluation have already surpassed the need for this course. This is a waste of time and resources.

These are listed as 'General Education Courses' worth of **30/133 credit hours**

### 3.Non-permitted devices
We meet different types of teachers, each with their own characteristics, style of teaching, temperament and rules etc. Similarly, we must understand that there are different types of students.

Some don't have the courage to ask questions, some aren't satisfied with the pace of the course, some have alot of questions etc. the list goes on.

The solution to this problem is use of laptops between lectures. I haven't seen a single course online where laptops aren't allowed. For example, even [Harvard's CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/), arguably the best **Introduction to Computer Science** course in the world shows students actively coding, taking notes, reviewing slides and paying attention to the Instructor.

 *Why do our Professors have strict rules of not allowing use of laptops?*
